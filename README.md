# CapstoneAnnikaArel
This is my capstone project, which is an attack and defense system that simulates attacks on the computer. It is built with Python 3.11 with the help of Tkinter for our GUI. With that said, we also have JSON for storing user data, and we will be using PyInstaller to make this applicaiton an .exe file so everyone can have this!

For my capstone project, my goals are to build a simulator that is similar to the outside world. We want to be able to simulate attacks that we can visulaize for people that are not in the tech world so they understand the risks they take by being online. With the risks also come understanding and learning, with ArelGuard I want people to be able to learn how to defend these attacks which will take a heavy load off many company's IT staff. Now if I have enough time I would like to introduce an AI chat box that will allow users to chat with in case they don't understand some of the defenses, or attacks. 

How to run the app:
 First we need to make an account, or you may login if you already have an account.
 You will then choose the path you'd like to go down, attack or defense. Or we can look at the menu on the left of the screen that can take you to attack, defense, overview, settings, account, or you may log out. 
 If you choose attack it will take you to the attack page, it will have a threat analysis in the left and it will give you three modes to pick from, easy, medium, hard. Once you press on one of the three it will take you to the attack simulator to see what each of them look like.
 If you press on defense, it will take you to a screen with threats happening now, you can either press on watch, you can try with some help to see what it is, or you can try it full on your own to see if you can defend it. 
 If you go to the settings page you can go into account username or account information. You can also change your difficulty there if you'd like. 
 Overview will just take you back to choose your path, and attack and defense will take you to their pages.
