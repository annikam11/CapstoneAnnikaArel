Capstone Resources  
Annika Arel

Resource 1:  
[How To Master The Python Tkinter Canvas?](https://pythonguides.com/python-tkinter-canvas/)  
This is a great resource for me because the first week is designing what my capstone will look like. With Tkinter Canvas Module it will allow me to make an interactive GUI for my users. This resource can help me with the handling of each element, even as simple as pressing a button and getting an outcome from it. 

Resource 2:  
[Using PyInstaller — PyInstaller 6.17.0 documentation](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/usage.html)  
This is a great resource because it is the full documentation of PyInstaller, in order for my project to work I need it to be an .exe file that can be downloaded. This will go over writing scripts to make it work, and making sure my full application can be turned into an .exe file.  This will also teach me everything I need to know about how to use PyInstaller, and also how to install it. 

Resource 3:  
[Mastering JSON: Creating, Handling, and Working with JSON Files | Cuantum Technologies](https://www.cuantum.tech/post/mastering-json-creating-handling-and-working-with-json-files)  
Understanding JSON structure will help with setting up user profiles, storing data, and making sure everything is structured so it is easy to read. With this resource this will allow me to understand arrays, json structure, creating json files, and all rules, some documentation. 

Resource 4:  
[Comprehensive Exposure Management Software \- Cymulate](https://cymulate.com/solutions/exposure-management/) \- Cymulate is one of the other simulators that are out in the real world. They have AI in the top right corner to help with any questions you may have. One of the things I like about their product is that they have severity analysis which can help with overall looking at those numbers. They also have a place in their product where you can go to look at the different types of attacks which can come in handy to know what you’re looking for. Something that I would like to implement would be is the connectors. They have all different types of connectors for integration which I think could be helpful to see what tools could work best in a simulation environment.   
Resource 5:  
[Automated Security Validation Platform | Picus](https://www.picussecurity.com/security-validation-platform?hsCtaAttrib=154957594225) \- Picus is another of the automated simulators that are out there. They have 3 different sections of their platform, which is exposure assessment, security validation, and exposure validation. I like that from those 3 sections, they have more to each section, with exposure assessment it could be external attack, with security it could be detection rule validation, and with exposure it could be cloud security validation. 

Finding more people that have built their simulators alone: 

Resource 6:  
[HellRush: Building a Python-Based DDoS Simulation Toolkit for Security Education \- DEV Community](https://dev.to/medjahdi/hellrush-building-a-python-based-ddos-simulation-toolkit-for-security-education-52f6) : He shows how he built his in python, he wanted a controlled environment to help with learning, something similar to mine, which was helpful. 

Resource 7:  
[Python For Cybersecurity Training Simulations \- Code With C](https://www.codewithc.com/python-for-cybersecurity-training-simulations/) : This shows the code that they used for DDoS which I could implement DDoS into my own simulator so I can have multiple different attacks. They also explain the code for learning which I found was very helpful. 

Resource 8:  
[Mastering Offensive and Defensive Strategies with Python for Cyber Security | TechAnnouncer](https://techannouncer.com/mastering-offensive-and-defensive-strategies-with-python-for-cyber-security/) : One of the best ones that I’ve read for learning the process of building a simulator in Python. It talks about different ways to do it, different libraries to use, and incident responses. I definitely could implement a lot of these libraries with Python that could help me simulate a good portion of the attacks and defense.
